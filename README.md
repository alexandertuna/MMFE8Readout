# MMFE8Readout FW

This based on the *X-4b2h-XADC* version from Arizona. 

Building the entire project from scratch is currently not guaranteed to work. This is in progress.

To run the build tcl script, do:

    vivado -mode batch -source build.tcl

This will create a project directory *mmfe* with associated xpr project file.

Please contact Tuna to be added as a collaborator on the repository. We will probably add tags to the NSW ELX SVN.
